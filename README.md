## The idea in one minute

AI agents can write code fast. That isn't the hard part of client work any more. The hard part is everything around the code:

- **Understanding** what the client actually needs, when the request is vague.
- **Directing** agents with a clear plan, instead of letting them guess.
- **Verifying** what they produce, so it is safe to ship.
- **Delivering** a whole product a client can run, not a pile of features.

This roadmap trains those four skills on **real job descriptions**, one deliverable at a time, inside your own GitHub repository.

## The journey

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  req(["A vague client request"])

  subgraph understand ["Understand"]
    direction TB
    p1["1 · Agent workflow"] --> p2["2 · Product discovery"] --> p3["3 · Architecture"]
  end

  subgraph build ["4 · Build in your field"]
    direction TB
    web["Web / SaaS"]
    mob["Mobile"]
    cms["CMS"]
  end

  subgraph engineer ["Engineer"]
    direction TB
    p5["5 · Agents"] --> p6["6 · MCP and skills"] --> p7["7 · Evals, security, quality"]
  end

  subgraph deliver ["Deliver"]
    direction TB
    p8["8 · Client delivery"] --> p9(["9 · AI software factory"])
  end

  req --> understand --> build --> engineer --> deliver
```

You build **one product** in Phase 4, in your own field. In Phases 5 to 7 you keep improving that same product with agents, evals, security and quality gates. Phase 0 is an optional warm-up.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a["1 · Use this template"] --> b["2 · Run Start roadmap"] --> c["3 · Work through issues"] --> d["4 · Deliver in pull requests"] --> e["5 · Track progress by phase"]
```

| Step | What you do | What happens |
|:---:|---|---|
| **1** | Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** | You get your own copy. Keep it public as a portfolio, or private. |
| **2** | In your copy: **Actions** → **Start roadmap** → **Run workflow**. Choose your field and starting phase. | An issue is created for every module, and a milestone for every phase. |
| **3** | Open the next issue and read the module | Each module has an objective, a practical task, a deliverable and a Definition of Done. |
| **4** | Put your work in `work/` and open a pull request that closes the issue | The pull request template asks what you verified yourself and where you overrode the agent. |
| **5** | Merge it | The issue closes, and the phase's milestone shows how far you've got. |

## Who it is for

| ✅ A good fit if you… | ❌ Not a good fit if you… |
|---|---|
| Already build software in a field: web, mobile or CMS | Are learning to program for the first time |
| Read technical English comfortably | Want video lessons to watch from start to finish |
| Want to deliver whole products, not single features | Want a certificate more than a portfolio |
| Can give a few focused hours a week, on your own | Need someone to set your schedule |

## The roadmap

In total, about **210 to 320 hours**, depending on your field and where you start: roughly five to eight months at 10 hours a week. Each module states its own estimate.

| **7 · Evals, security and quality gates** | [7.1 Define success before optimizing the agent](modules/7.1-define-success/README.md)<br>[7.2 Regression testing for agent systems](modules/7.2-regression-testing/README.md)<br>[7.3 Safe agentic engineering](modules/7.3-safe-agentic-engineering/README.md)<br>[7.4 Quality gates: CI/CD, end-to-end tests and release readiness](modules/7.4-quality-gates/README.md) |
| **8 · Client delivery** | [8.1 From prototype to a production plan](modules/8.1-prototype-to-production/README.md)<br>[8.2 Proposal, milestones and handover](modules/8.2-proposal-and-handover/README.md) |
| **9 · Capstone: the AI software factory** | [9.1 Design the AI software factory](modules/9.1-design-the-factory/README.md)<br>[9.2 Implement the AI software factory](modules/9.2-implement-the-factory/README.md)<br>[9.3 Run a new job description end to end and ship](modules/9.3-ship-a-new-jd/README.md) |

## Practise on real job descriptions

Every project starts from a real job description, the way client work does. Find one on a freelance marketplace, or use one from the [`jds/`](jds/README.md) folder. Names and identifying details are removed.

## Free workshop

A live workshop walks through the roadmap so you can follow it on your own and get the most out of it. To join, you need:

1. English at **B2 or above** on the free [EF SET](https://efset.org/ef-set-50) test (50 minutes, reading and listening). You get a certificate link to share when you book.
2. Prior experience in your field

**[Book a seat on ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/abdelrahman-haridy?session=agentic-engineering-roadmap-ac7b-mvqqyv18)** and paste your EF SET certificate link in the booking note.

- **At scale:** has led front-end work on large platforms, including a global healthcare company's medical site serving 19 countries.
- **Products:** his templates and Angular components on Envato have sold 125 times.
- **Teaches:** has taught tech skills at several Egyptian universities, trained web developers at Egypt's Information Technology Institute (ITI) from 2016 to 2019, and is listed among the Top 50 front-end mentors on ADPList.

This roadmap puts that experience into one path: a real request, a clear brief, AI agents doing the heavy lifting, and every step verified before it ships.
